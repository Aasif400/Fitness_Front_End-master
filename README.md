Describing the functionality and user interface of a Fitness Trainer Appointment Scheduling Website.

Calendar Page:

When the user clicks on the "Calendar" button, the website redirects to the calendar page.
The calendar page displays all the scheduled appointments of the trainer.
Add User:

To add a user, the website provides a form where the fitness trainer can input the user's details.
The required details include First Name, Last Name, Location, and Appointment information.
Delete Appointment:

In the appointment table, each row should have a "Delete" button.
Clicking the "Delete" button for a specific user's appointment removes that appointment from the schedule.
Update User Details:

The user details table has an "Edit" button for each user.
Clicking the "Edit" button opens a form with the user's details pre-filled for editing.
The form automatically fetches the existing data, but the appointment data is not displayed initially.
If the fitness trainer wants to update the appointment, they can edit it separately.
Edit Appointment:

When editing a user, if the trainer wants to modify the appointment, there's a section specifically for updating appointment details.
If no changes are made to the appointment section, the existing appointment data remains unchanged.
In summary, the website provides a user-friendly interface for fitness trainers to manage appointments. The calendar page gives an overview of all appointments, the add user functionality allows for inputting user details and appointments, and the edit/delete options provide flexibility for managing existing user appointments.
